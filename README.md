# Overview
Database Schema Control (dsc), is a tool to help manage changes and migrations of a database.
It does * not * however replace git (hg, svn, etc) for tracking files changes, instead it tracks
schema and data changes against a database, or a list of databases.

Currently it is not even alpha, and is being fleshed out for full features and capabilities.
Please see issue tracking for future todo's and tasks in progress.
