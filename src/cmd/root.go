usage: dsc [--version][--help][--webpage][--doc] [<command> [<args>]

These are common dsc commands:

Start a working directory:
    init      Create a working directory for dsc.

Work on a scema change:
    add       Add file to be tracked by local dsc index.
    rm        Remove file from local dsc index.

Examine history and state of schema changes:
    log       Show previously applied changes.
    status    Show working status.
    diff      Show diff between two databases.

Collaborate:
    pull      Fetch a copy of a schema from a remote database.
    populate  Fetch a copy of a schema from a remote database and it's entries.
    push      Apply schema to a remote database.
    dryrun    Test schema changes against a remote database (in an uncommited transaction).
